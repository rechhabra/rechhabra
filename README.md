# Hi! Welcome to my profile!
As a highly motivated and multidisciplinary individual with a passion for computer science, mathematics, sports, and art, I am actively seeking full-time and research opportunities for 2024. My primary interests are in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and architectural design, as I am currently working towards a degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Art History. Additionally, I am concurrently pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

When I'm not busy, I love to spend my time doing things including reading, baking, painting, running, dancing, playing chess, traveling, photography, trying new sports, and practicing martial arts. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out about anything!
